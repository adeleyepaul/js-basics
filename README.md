6.  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
    Statically typed programming languages are those in which the type of a variable must be declared before it is used. In other words, the data type of a variable is fixed at compile-time and cannot be changed at runtime. Examples of statically typed programming languages include: Java, C++, C# Swift.

    Dynamically typed programming languages are those in which the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change during the course of the program. In these languages, variables do not have a declared type, and their type is determined based on the value assigned to them. Examples of dynamically typed programming languages include: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
7.  Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined
    undefined: is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared, but has not been assigned a value. 
    null: is a value that represents a deliberate non-value, and must be assigned explicitly.
